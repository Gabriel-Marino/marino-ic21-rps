Basically what i have produced to my Cientific Iniciation (from portuguese, Iniciação Científica), everything is based on this [article] (https://github.com/Gabriel-Marino/marino-ic21-rps/blob/main/avelino2012.pdf).

I have used the RPS, Lotka-Volterra and May-Leonards models to simulate the competition between 3, 4 and 5 species.

Those i have used Runge-Kutta method is totally based on the solution of Lotka-Volterra equations.

Those i have used Sthocastic method is totally based on random number generation and on the species dynamic, besides spiral ones models have used one boundary conditions thats differes from the boundary conditions to the domains ones models; these name are based in the expected result for each one, where spirals models generate spirals and domains generates clusters of each specie.

WHat differs from each boundary condition is, in the Spiral ones each specie cannot predate they predator, but in Domain they can.
